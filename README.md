This is my Honors Senior Thesis paper that was required to graduate SUNY Cortland in 3 years in the Honors Program 
The paper was planned in the fall of sophmore semester and worked on the spring of my sophmore semester, during summer break, and my whole junior year and winter break.
Word, Excel, and Stata were used to created this project
